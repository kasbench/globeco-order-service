# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is failing to start due to a Spring Boot bean definition conflict. There are two `httpClient` beans defined - one in `GlobecoOrderServiceApplication` and another in `HttpClientConfiguration`. When the metrics feature is enabled (`metrics.custom.enabled=true`), both beans are created, causing Spring to fail startup with a `BeanDefinitionOverrideException`. This needs to be resolved to allow the application to start successfully regardless of metrics configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to start successfully when metrics are disabled, so that I can run the application without custom metrics functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metrics are disabled (metrics.custom.enabled=false or not set) THEN the application SHALL start successfully using the httpClient bean from GlobecoOrderServiceApplication
2. WHEN metrics are disabled THEN the HttpClientConfiguration SHALL NOT create any conflicting beans
3. WHEN the application starts with metrics disabled THEN all existing HTTP functionality SHALL work as expected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to start successfully when metrics are enabled, so that I can use both HTTP functionality and custom metrics monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metrics are enabled (metrics.custom.enabled=true) THEN the application SHALL start successfully without bean definition conflicts
2. WHEN metrics are enabled THEN only one httpClient bean SHALL be present in the Spring context
3. WHEN metrics are enabled THEN the HTTP metrics monitoring functionality SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN metrics are enabled THEN all existing HTTP functionality SHALL continue to work as expected

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean separation of concerns between core HTTP functionality and metrics-specific HTTP configuration, so that the codebase is maintainable and the configurations don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the code THEN the core HTTP client configuration SHALL be clearly separated from metrics-specific configuration
2. WHEN metrics configuration changes THEN it SHALL NOT affect the core application's HTTP client setup
3. WHEN the application starts THEN there SHALL be no duplicate or conflicting bean definitions
4. WHEN reviewing the configuration THEN it SHALL be clear which HTTP client is being used in different scenarios
