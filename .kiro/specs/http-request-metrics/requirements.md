# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements standardized HTTP request metrics for the GlobeCo Order Service that can be exported to the OpenTelemetry (Otel) Collector. These metrics provide consistent observability across all HTTP endpoints including API endpoints, health checks, and error responses, following the microservices HTTP metrics requirements specification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to track the total number of HTTP requests across all endpoints, so that I can monitor service usage patterns and identify high-traffic endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HTTP request is completed THEN the system SHALL increment a counter metric named `http_requests_total`
2. WHEN the counter is incremented THEN the system SHALL include labels for `method` (HTTP method), `path` (request route), and `status` (HTTP status code as string)
3. WHEN the metric is recorded THEN the system SHALL capture all HTTP requests including API endpoints, health checks, static files, and error responses
4. WHEN HTTP methods are recorded THEN the system SHALL use uppercase format (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to measure HTTP request duration to identify performance bottlenecks and monitor response times across different endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an HTTP request is processed THEN the system SHALL record the duration in a histogram metric named `http_request_duration_seconds`
2. WHEN duration is measured THEN the system SHALL start timing when the request enters the application layer and stop when the response is fully written
3. WHEN the histogram is recorded THEN the system SHALL include the same labels as the counter: `method`, `path`, and `status`
4. WHEN duration is recorded THEN the system SHALL use seconds as the unit with floating point precision
5. WHEN histogram buckets are configured THEN the system SHALL use standard buckets: [0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10]

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to monitor concurrent HTTP requests to understand system load and identify potential resource contention issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP requests are being processed THEN the system SHALL maintain a gauge metric named `http_requests_in_flight`
2. WHEN a request starts processing THEN the system SHALL increment the in-flight gauge
3. WHEN a request completes processing THEN the system SHALL decrement the in-flight gauge regardless of success or failure
4. WHEN the gauge is maintained THEN the system SHALL not include any labels (global gauge for all requests)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want HTTP metrics to be collected automatically through middleware integration, so that all endpoints are monitored without manual instrumentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL register HTTP middleware that captures metrics for all HTTP requests
2. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL record metrics transparently without interfering with normal request processing
3. WHEN metric recording fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue processing the request normally
4. WHEN endpoints are monitored THEN the system SHALL use route patterns (e.g., "/api/users/{id}") instead of actual URLs with parameters

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a monitoring engineer, I want HTTP metrics to integrate with existing OpenTelemetry configuration, so that they appear in our current monitoring dashboards without additional setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTP metrics are implemented THEN the system SHALL use the existing Micrometer MeterRegistry configuration
2. WHEN metrics are exported THEN the system SHALL send data to the same OTLP endpoint configured in application.properties
3. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL include the same resource attributes (service.name, service.version, service.namespace) as existing metrics
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL register all HTTP metrics without requiring additional configuration changes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want HTTP metrics to avoid exposing sensitive information in labels, so that monitoring data doesn't leak confidential data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN path labels are created THEN the system SHALL use route patterns that sanitize path parameters
2. WHEN sensitive data might be present in URLs THEN the system SHALL replace it with generic placeholders
3. WHEN status codes are recorded THEN the system SHALL convert numeric codes to string format ("200", "404", "500")
4. WHEN high-cardinality labels are avoided THEN the system SHALL limit unique endpoint values to prevent metric explosion
