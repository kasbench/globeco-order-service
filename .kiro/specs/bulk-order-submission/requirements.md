# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the order service's batch submission functionality by implementing bulk order submission to the trade service. Currently, the `SubmitOrdersBatch` method processes orders individually, calling the trade service once per order, which creates significant overhead and performance issues. The trade service provides a bulk endpoint (`POST /api/v1/tradeOrders/bulk`) that accepts multiple orders in a single atomic transaction, which will dramatically improve performance and reduce processing time.

The enhancement will replace the current individual order submission approach with a single bulk API call while maintaining the existing order service API contract and ensuring proper error handling and logging.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trading system operator, I want the order service to submit orders to the trade service in bulk rather than individually, so that batch processing performance is significantly improved and system overhead is reduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the order service receives a batch submission request THEN it SHALL collect all valid orders and send them to the trade service using the bulk endpoint in a single HTTP request
2. WHEN using the bulk submission endpoint THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing API contract for `POST /api/v1/orders/batch/submit` without breaking changes
3. WHEN processing bulk submissions THEN the system SHALL eliminate the current individual order processing loop that calls the trade service multiple times
4. WHEN submitting orders in bulk THEN the processing time SHALL be significantly reduced compared to the current individual submission approach

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for bulk submissions, so that I can effectively debug issues and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the trade service returns an error response THEN the system SHALL log the complete error details including status code, response body, and all relevant context
2. WHEN individual orders within a bulk request fail THEN the system SHALL map the trade service response back to individual order results for the client
3. WHEN network or connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and provide meaningful error messages to clients
4. WHEN the bulk submission succeeds THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics including batch size and processing duration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client application, I want to receive the same response format for batch submissions regardless of whether they are processed individually or in bulk, so that my integration remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bulk submission is processed THEN the response format SHALL match the existing `BatchSubmitResponseDTO` structure exactly
2. WHEN the trade service returns bulk results THEN the system SHALL transform them into individual `OrderSubmitResultDTO` objects with correct request indices
3. WHEN orders succeed or fail in the bulk operation THEN each result SHALL contain the appropriate status, message, and trade order ID information
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the response SHALL maintain the same error format and HTTP status codes as the current implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want the bulk submission process to efficiently manage database connections and transactions, so that system resources are used optimally and connection pool exhaustion is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing bulk submissions THEN the system SHALL minimize database connection usage by batching database operations
2. WHEN updating order statuses after bulk submission THEN the system SHALL use efficient batch update operations rather than individual updates
3. WHEN the trade service call is in progress THEN the system SHALL NOT hold database connections unnecessarily
4. WHEN errors occur during bulk processing THEN the system SHALL properly release all database resources and maintain transaction integrity

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the bulk submission to properly handle the trade service's bulk API format and constraints, so that all orders are processed correctly according to the trade service specifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN preparing bulk requests THEN the system SHALL format orders according to the `BulkTradeOrderRequestDTO` structure with the `tradeOrders` array
2. WHEN sending bulk requests THEN the system SHALL include all required fields: orderId, portfolioId, orderType, securityId, quantity, limitPrice, tradeTimestamp, and blotterId
3. WHEN receiving bulk responses THEN the system SHALL parse the `BulkTradeOrderResponseDTO` structure and extract individual results from the `results` array
4. WHEN the trade service returns atomic success or failure THEN the system SHALL handle both scenarios appropriately and update order statuses accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a performance monitor, I want the bulk submission implementation to maintain or improve upon existing batch size limits and validation, so that system stability is preserved while gaining performance benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating batch requests THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing maximum batch size limit of 100 orders for submission
2. WHEN processing bulk submissions THEN the system SHALL validate that all orders are in the correct status (NEW) before sending to the trade service
3. WHEN orders are already reserved or processed THEN the system SHALL handle these cases gracefully and report appropriate errors
4. WHEN the bulk request exceeds trade service limits THEN the system SHALL handle the error appropriately and provide clear feedback to clients
