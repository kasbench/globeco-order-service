# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive custom OpenTelemetry metrics to the GlobeCo Order Service to provide detailed observability into database connection pool performance and HTTP client connection pool behavior. The metrics will integrate with the existing OpenTelemetry infrastructure and follow Prometheus naming conventions to ensure consistency with the current monitoring stack.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to monitor database connection pool performance, so that I can identify bottlenecks and optimize database connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database connection is requested THEN the system SHALL record the total acquisition duration in a histogram metric named `db_connection_acquisition_duration_seconds`
2. WHEN the database connection pool reaches maximum capacity THEN the system SHALL increment a counter metric named `db_pool_exhaustion_events_total`
3. WHEN a database connection acquisition fails THEN the system SHALL increment a counter metric named `db_connection_acquisition_failures_total`
4. WHEN metrics are exported THEN the system SHALL include current database pool state via gauge metrics: `db_pool_connections_total`, `db_pool_connections_active`, and `db_pool_connections_idle`

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to monitor HTTP client connection pool performance, so that I can optimize external service communication and identify connection issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metrics are exported THEN the system SHALL provide HTTP connection pool metrics via gauge metrics: `http_pool_connections_total`, `http_pool_connections_active`, and `http_pool_connections_idle`
2. WHEN HTTP connection pool metrics are recorded THEN the system SHALL include a `protocol` label with values `http` or `https`
3. WHEN the application makes HTTP requests to external services THEN the system SHALL track connection pool utilization for both Security Service and Portfolio Service clients

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want custom metrics to integrate seamlessly with existing OpenTelemetry configuration, so that I don't need to modify deployment or monitoring infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom metrics are implemented THEN the system SHALL use the existing Micrometer MeterRegistry configuration
2. WHEN metrics are exported THEN the system SHALL send data to the same OTLP endpoint configured in application.properties
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL register all custom metrics without requiring additional configuration changes
4. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL include the same resource attributes (service.name, service.version, service.namespace) as existing metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a monitoring engineer, I want metrics to follow Prometheus naming conventions, so that they integrate well with our existing dashboards and alerting rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN counter metrics are created THEN the system SHALL use the `_total` suffix
2. WHEN duration metrics are created THEN the system SHALL use the `_seconds` suffix and histogram type
3. WHEN gauge metrics are created THEN the system SHALL use descriptive names without time-based suffixes
4. WHEN metrics are named THEN the system SHALL use snake_case format with clear, descriptive names

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want metrics to be automatically collected without manual intervention, so that monitoring works consistently across all application instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically begin collecting all custom metrics
2. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL automatically record relevant metrics without explicit instrumentation in business logic
3. WHEN HTTP requests are made THEN the system SHALL automatically capture connection pool metrics
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL properly clean up metric collection resources
