# Connection Pool Optimization Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing `CannotCreateTransactionException` errors due to connection pool exhaustion:
- HikariPool-1 showing all 20 connections active with 74 requests waiting
- Connection timeout after 30 seconds
- Errors occurring during batch order processing

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Insufficient Connection Pool Size**: Only 20 connections for high-load batch processing
2. **Long-Running Transactions**: Large batch methods holding connections for extended periods
3. **Inefficient Transaction Boundaries**: Processing up to 1000 orders in single transactions
4. **Suboptimal Connection Pool Configuration**: Default settings not optimized for workload

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Increased Connection Pool Size
**File**: `src/main/resources/application.properties`
- Increased `maximum-pool-size` from 20 to 50 (150% increase)
- Increased `minimum-idle` from 5 to 10
- Reduced `connection-timeout` from 30s to 20s (fail faster)
- Reduced `idle-timeout` from 10min to 5min (recycle idle connections faster)
- Reduced `max-lifetime` from 30min to 20min (prevent stale connections)
- Reduced `leak-detection-threshold` from 60s to 30s (detect leaks faster)
- Added `validation-timeout` and `initialization-fail-timeout` for better error handling

### 2. Optimized Transaction Boundaries
**File**: `src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_order_service/service/OrderService.java`

#### Before:
```java
@Transactional
public OrderListResponseDTO processBatchOrders(List<OrderPostDTO> orders) {
    // Process up to 1000 orders in single transaction
    for (OrderPostDTO order : orders) {
        // Database operations holding connection for entire batch
    }
}
```

#### After:
```java
public OrderListResponseDTO processBatchOrders(List<OrderPostDTO> orders) {
    // No transaction at batch level
    for (OrderPostDTO order : orders) {
        // Each order processed in its own transaction
        processIndividualOrderInTransaction(order, index);
    }
}

@Transactional
public OrderPostResponseDTO processIndividualOrderInTransaction(OrderPostDTO order, int index) {
    // Short-lived transaction per order
}
```

### 3. Added JPA/Hibernate Optimizations
**File**: `src/main/resources/application.properties`
- Enabled batch processing: `hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=25`
- Optimized insert/update ordering: `hibernate.order_inserts=true`, `hibernate.order_updates=true`
- Added transaction timeout: `spring.transaction.default-timeout=30`
- Optimized autocommit handling

### 4. Enhanced HTTP Client Configuration
**File**: `src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_order_service/GlobecoOrderServiceApplication.java`
- Added read timeout to prevent hanging connections
- Maintained existing connection pooling for HTTP clients

### 5. Added Connection Pool Monitoring
**File**: `src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_order_service/service/ConnectionPoolMonitoringService.java`
- Real-time monitoring of connection pool utilization
- Automatic warnings at 80% utilization
- Critical alerts at 95% utilization and when threads are waiting
- Scheduled monitoring every 30 seconds

### 6. Enabled Scheduling Support
**File**: `src/main/java/org/kasbench/globeco_order_service/GlobecoOrderServiceApplication.java`
- Added `@EnableScheduling` for connection pool monitoring

## Expected Impact

### Performance Improvements:
- **150% more connections**: 20 → 50 connections available
- **Faster failure detection**: 30s → 20s connection timeout
- **Reduced connection holding time**: Individual transactions vs batch transactions
- **Better connection recycling**: Shorter idle and max lifetime

### Reliability Improvements:
- **Proactive monitoring**: Early warning system for connection pool issues
- **Faster leak detection**: 60s → 30s leak detection threshold
- **Transaction timeouts**: Prevent runaway transactions
- **Better error handling**: Faster failure detection and recovery

### Scalability Improvements:
- **Higher concurrent load**: More connections support more simultaneous requests
- **Better resource utilization**: Shorter-lived transactions free up connections faster
- **Batch processing optimization**: Each order in separate transaction prevents blocking

## Monitoring and Alerting

The new `ConnectionPoolMonitoringService` will log:
- **DEBUG**: Normal utilization status every 30 seconds
- **WARN**: High utilization (≥80%) with connection details
- **ERROR**: Critical utilization (≥95%) or threads waiting for connections

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Monitor the logs** for connection pool warnings after deployment
2. **Adjust pool size** if still seeing high utilization warnings
3. **Consider implementing** circuit breakers for external service calls
4. **Review batch sizes** if processing very large batches (>100 orders)
5. **Set up alerts** on the ERROR level connection pool messages

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Load test** with concurrent batch order processing
2. **Verify** connection pool monitoring is working
3. **Test** error scenarios (database unavailable, slow external services)
4. **Confirm** transaction boundaries are working as expected
