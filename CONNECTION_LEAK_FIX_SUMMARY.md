# Connection Leak Fix Summary - ENHANCED

## Problem Analysis

The connection leak warnings were occurring because database connections were being held for longer than the 15-second leak detection threshold. The issues were:

1. **Long-running transactions**: Spring's `@Transactional` annotations were holding connections during external service calls
2. **Connection pool exhaustion**: With 100 concurrent users, even "short" transactions were queuing and timing out
3. **Spring transaction overhead**: Declarative transaction management was adding latency to connection acquisition/release
4. **Lack of concurrency control**: No limits on concurrent database operations

## Root Cause

```java
@Transactional  // ❌ This held connections during external service calls
public OrderSubmitResultDTO submitIndividualOrderInTransaction(Integer orderId, Integer requestIndex) {
    // Database read (connection acquired)
    Order order = orderRepository.findById(orderId).orElseThrow();
    
    // External service call (connection still held!) ❌
    Integer tradeOrderId = callTradeService(order);
    
    // Database write (connection still held)
    updateOrderAfterSubmission(order, tradeOrderId);
    // Connection finally released here
}
```

## Enhanced Solution Implemented

### 1. Manual Transaction Management
Replaced Spring's `@Transactional` annotations with `TransactionTemplate` for precise control:

```java
// ✅ Manual transaction management with timeouts
private final TransactionTemplate transactionTemplate;
private final TransactionTemplate readOnlyTransactionTemplate;

public OrderService(..., PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager) {
    this.transactionTemplate = new TransactionTemplate(transactionManager);
    this.transactionTemplate.setTimeout(5); // 5 second timeout
    
    this.readOnlyTransactionTemplate = new TransactionTemplate(transactionManager);
    this.readOnlyTransactionTemplate.setReadOnly(true);
    this.readOnlyTransactionTemplate.setTimeout(3); // 3 second timeout for reads
}

public Order loadAndValidateOrder(Integer orderId) {
    return readOnlyTransactionTemplate.execute(status -> {
        try {
            return orderRepository.findById(orderId).orElse(null);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            status.setRollbackOnly();
            return null;
        }
    });
}
```

### 2. Semaphore-Based Concurrency Control
Added semaphore to limit concurrent database operations:

```java
// ✅ Limit concurrent database operations to prevent pool exhaustion
private final Semaphore databaseOperationSemaphore = new Semaphore(25);

public Order loadAndValidateOrder(Integer orderId) {
    if (!databaseOperationSemaphore.tryAcquire(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
        logger.warn("Database operation semaphore timeout for order {} load", orderId);
        return null;
    }
    
    try {
        return readOnlyTransactionTemplate.execute(status -> {
            // Database operation
        });
    } finally {
        databaseOperationSemaphore.release();
    }
}
```

### 2. Status Caching
Added caching for the SENT status to reduce repeated database lookups:

```java
private volatile Status cachedSentStatus;

private Status getSentStatus() {
    if (cachedSentStatus == null) {
        synchronized (this) {
            if (cachedSentStatus == null) {
                cachedSentStatus = statusRepository.findAll().stream()
                        .filter(s -> "SENT".equals(s.getAbbreviation()))
                        .findFirst()
                        .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("SENT status not found"));
            }
        }
    }
    return cachedSentStatus;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
Added proper error handling for the case where order status changes between the read and write operations.

## Expected Impact

### Connection Pool Utilization
- **Before**: Connections held for 15+ seconds (triggering leak detection)
- **After**: Connections held for <1 second with strict timeouts

### Concurrency Control
- **Before**: Unlimited concurrent database operations causing pool exhaustion
- **After**: Maximum 25 concurrent database operations with 2-second timeout

### Transaction Management
- **Before**: Spring's declarative transaction management with overhead
- **After**: Manual transaction management with precise control and timeouts

### Connection Leak Prevention
- **Before**: Connections leaked due to long-running transactions and Spring overhead
- **After**: Guaranteed connection release with timeout protection and semaphore limits

## Monitoring

### Success Indicators
- ✅ No more "Connection leak detection triggered" warnings in logs
- ✅ Connection pool utilization stays below 50% during batch processing
- ✅ No threads waiting for connections (`threadsAwaitingConnection = 0`)
- ✅ Batch processing completes successfully with 100 concurrent users

### Key Metrics to Watch
```bash
# Check connection pool health
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/system/health | jq '.connectionPool'

# Monitor logs for connection issues
kubectl logs -f deployment/globeco-order-service | grep -E "(Connection leak|HikariPool)"
```

## Complementary Optimizations

The fix works in conjunction with existing emergency measures:

1. **ValidationCacheService**: Reduces database calls during validation
2. **ConnectionPoolCircuitBreaker**: Provides system protection during overload
3. **Increased pool size**: 100 connections provide buffer for peak loads
4. **Optimized timeouts**: Faster failure detection and recovery

## Testing Recommendations

### Load Test Scenarios
1. **Baseline**: 10 users, 10 orders per batch
2. **Target load**: 50 users, 50 orders per batch  
3. **Stress test**: 100 users, 100 orders per batch
4. **Failure scenario**: External service delays/timeouts

### Success Criteria
- No connection leak warnings
- All batches complete successfully
- Response times under 5 seconds for 50-order batches
- System remains stable during external service failures

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the changes can be quickly reverted by:

1. Restoring the original `@Transactional` annotation on `submitIndividualOrderInTransaction`
2. Reverting the method splitting changes
3. The existing emergency connection pool settings will still provide protection

## Long-term Recommendations

1. **Async processing**: Consider implementing async order processing for even better scalability
2. **Database connection monitoring**: Add detailed connection pool metrics to dashboards
3. **External service resilience**: Implement retry policies and circuit breakers for trade service calls
4. **Connection pool tuning**: Monitor and adjust pool sizes based on actual usage patterns
