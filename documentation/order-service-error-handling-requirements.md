# Order Service Error Handling Requirements

## Issue Summary

**Service**: GlobeCo Order Service  
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/orders`  
**Issue**: Incorrect HTTP status code for system overload conditions  
**Impact**: Prevents client retry mechanisms from functioning properly  
**Priority**: High  

## Problem Description

The Order Service is currently returning HTTP status code `400 Bad Request` for system overload conditions with the error message:

```
"Invalid order data: System temporarily overloaded - please retry in a few minutes"
```

### Current Behavior
- **HTTP Status**: 400 Bad Request
- **Error Message**: "Invalid order data: System temporarily overloaded - please retry in a few minutes"
- **Client Impact**: Clients treat this as a permanent client error and do not retry

### Expected Behavior
- **HTTP Status**: 503 Service Unavailable
- **Error Message**: "System temporarily overloaded - please retry in a few minutes"
- **Client Impact**: Clients can implement automatic retry logic for temporary service issues

## Technical Analysis

### Why This Is Problematic

1. **HTTP Semantics Violation**: 
   - 400 status codes indicate client errors (invalid request data)
   - System overload is a server-side capacity issue, not a client data problem

2. **Breaks Client Retry Logic**:
   - Most HTTP clients and retry libraries treat 4xx errors as permanent failures
   - 5xx errors are treated as temporary and eligible for retry
   - This prevents automatic recovery from transient overload conditions

3. **Misleading Error Classification**:
   - The error message suggests a temporary condition ("please retry in a few minutes")
   - The status code suggests a permanent client error
   - This creates confusion for both developers and monitoring systems

### Impact on Downstream Services

The Portfolio Management Portal service has implemented retry logic that:
- Retries on 5xx server errors with exponential backoff
- Does NOT retry on 4xx client errors
- Currently cannot recover from Order Service overload conditions

## Requirements

### 1. Correct HTTP Status Code (Required)

**Change the HTTP status code from `400 Bad Request` to `503 Service Unavailable` for system overload conditions.**

**Rationale**:
- RFC 7231 defines 503 as appropriate for temporary service unavailability
- Enables proper client-side retry behavior
- Aligns with HTTP semantic standards

### 2. Enhanced Error Response (Recommended)

**Provide structured error responses with retry guidance:**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "SERVICE_OVERLOADED",
    "message": "System temporarily overloaded - please retry in a few minutes",
    "retryAfter": 300,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Include HTTP headers:**
```
HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable
Retry-After: 300
Content-Type: application/json
```

### 3. Consistent Error Classification (Recommended)

**Establish clear guidelines for HTTP status code usage:**

| Condition | Status Code | Retry Behavior |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Invalid request data | 400 Bad Request | Do not retry |
| System overload | 503 Service Unavailable | Retry with backoff |
| Rate limiting | 429 Too Many Requests | Retry after delay |
| Internal errors | 500 Internal Server Error | Retry with backoff |
| Service maintenance | 503 Service Unavailable | Retry with backoff |

## Implementation Guidance

### Immediate Fix
```java
// Current (incorrect)
if (isSystemOverloaded()) {
    return ResponseEntity.badRequest()
        .body("Invalid order data: System temporarily overloaded - please retry in a few minutes");
}

// Corrected
if (isSystemOverloaded()) {
    return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE)
        .header("Retry-After", "300")
        .body(new ErrorResponse("SERVICE_OVERLOADED", 
              "System temporarily overloaded - please retry in a few minutes"));
}
```

### Detection Logic
The service should distinguish between:
- **Actual validation errors** (malformed JSON, missing required fields) → 400
- **System capacity issues** (thread pool exhaustion, database connection limits) → 503
- **Rate limiting** (too many requests from same client) → 429

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Load Testing
- Verify 503 status codes are returned under high load conditions
- Confirm Retry-After headers are present and accurate
- Test that service recovers properly after load decreases

### 2. Integration Testing
- Verify client retry logic works with corrected status codes
- Test exponential backoff behavior
- Confirm error monitoring and alerting work correctly

### 3. Regression Testing
- Ensure legitimate 400 errors still return 400 status codes
- Verify error message clarity and consistency

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics to Track
- Count of 503 responses (should correlate with system load)
- Average retry-after values
- Client retry success rates
- Time to recovery from overload conditions

### Alerting
- Alert on sustained 503 response rates above threshold
- Monitor for capacity planning needs
- Track client retry patterns

## Timeline and Priority

**Priority**: High - Affects system reliability and client experience  
**Effort**: Low - Simple status code change  
**Risk**: Low - Improves error handling without breaking existing functionality  

**Recommended Timeline**:
- Week 1: Implement status code fix and basic retry headers
- Week 2: Add structured error responses and enhanced monitoring
- Week 3: Deploy to staging and conduct integration testing
- Week 4: Production deployment with monitoring

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ System overload conditions return 503 status code instead of 400
2. ✅ Retry-After headers are included in overload responses
3. ✅ Client services successfully retry and recover from overload conditions
4. ✅ No regression in handling of legitimate 400 Bad Request scenarios
5. ✅ Monitoring dashboards show improved error classification
