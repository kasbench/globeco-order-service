# Supplemental Requirement 3: Batch Order Processing

## Overview
Modify the orders endpoint to support batch processing of multiple orders in a single request, with comprehensive error handling and appropriate HTTP status code responses.

## DTO Specifications

### OrderPostResponseDTO
Represents the result of processing a single order within a batch request.

| Field | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| status | String | "SUCCESS" or "FAILURE" - indicates if this individual order was processed successfully |
| message | String | Descriptive message (error details for failures, success confirmation for success) |
| order | OrderWithDetailsDTO | The created order details (only present when status is "SUCCESS") |
| orderId | Long | The ID of the created order (only present when status is "SUCCESS") |
| requestIndex | Integer | The zero-based index of this order in the original request array (for client correlation) |

### OrderListResponseDTO  
Represents the overall result of processing a batch of orders.

| Field | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| status | String | Overall batch status: "SUCCESS" (all succeeded), "FAILURE" (all failed), or "PARTIAL" (mixed results) |
| message | String | Summary message describing the overall result |
| totalReceived | Integer | Total number of orders in the request |
| successful | Integer | Number of orders successfully processed |
| failed | Integer | Number of orders that failed to process |
| orders | List&lt;OrderPostResponseDTO&gt; | Individual results for each order in the batch |

## API Specification

### Current Implementation
| Verb | Path | Request DTO | Response DTO | Status Codes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | api/v1/orders | OrderPostDTO | OrderWithDetailsDTO | 200, 400, 500 |

### New Implementation  
| Verb | Path | Request DTO | Response DTO | Status Codes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | api/v1/orders | List&lt;OrderPostDTO&gt; | OrderListResponseDTO | 200, 207, 400, 413, 500 |

## HTTP Status Code Usage

- **200 OK**: All orders in the batch were processed successfully
- **207 Multi-Status**: Partial success - some orders succeeded, others failed
- **400 Bad Request**: Request validation failed (invalid JSON, missing required fields, invalid data types)
- **413 Payload Too Large**: Batch size exceeds 1000 orders
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Unexpected server error preventing batch processing

## Error Handling Requirements

### Request Validation
1. **Batch Size Limit**: Accept maximum 1000 orders per batch
   - Return HTTP 413 if limit exceeded
   - Include descriptive error message

2. **JSON Validation**: Validate request structure
   - Return HTTP 400 for malformed JSON
   - Return HTTP 400 for missing required fields
   - Return HTTP 400 for invalid data types

3. **Business Logic Validation**: For each individual order
   - Validate customer exists
   - Validate product exists  
   - Validate quantities are positive
   - Include validation errors in individual OrderPostResponseDTO

### Processing Logic
1. **Atomic vs Non-Atomic**: Process orders individually (non-atomic batch)
   - Continue processing remaining orders even if some fail
   - Each order success/failure is independent

2. **Individual Order Failures**: Common failure scenarios
   - Customer not found
   - Product not found or insufficient inventory
   - Invalid business rules (negative quantities, etc.)
   - Database constraints violations
   - Trade service integration failures

3. **Trade Service Integration**: For each successful order
   - Submit to trade service as per existing requirements
   - Set tradeOrderId if trade service succeeds
   - Order is still considered successful even if trade service fails

## Response Examples

### All Success (HTTP 200)
```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "message": "All 3 orders processed successfully",
  "totalReceived": 3,
  "successful": 3,
  "failed": 0,
  "orders": [
    {
      "status": "SUCCESS",
      "message": "Order created successfully",
      "order": { /* OrderWithDetailsDTO */ },
      "orderId": 123,
      "requestIndex": 0
    }
    // ... additional successful orders
  ]
}
```

### Partial Success (HTTP 207)
```json
{
  "status": "PARTIAL", 
  "message": "2 of 3 orders processed successfully",
  "totalReceived": 3,
  "successful": 2,
  "failed": 1,
  "orders": [
    {
      "status": "SUCCESS",
      "message": "Order created successfully", 
      "order": { /* OrderWithDetailsDTO */ },
      "orderId": 123,
      "requestIndex": 0
    },
    {
      "status": "FAILURE",
      "message": "Customer with ID 999 not found",
      "requestIndex": 1
    },
    {
      "status": "SUCCESS", 
      "message": "Order created successfully",
      "order": { /* OrderWithDetailsDTO */ },
      "orderId": 124,
      "requestIndex": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

### Request Validation Error (HTTP 400)
```json
{
  "status": "FAILURE",
  "message": "Invalid request: customerId is required for all orders",
  "totalReceived": 0,
  "successful": 0, 
  "failed": 0,
  "orders": []
}
```

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Not required - breaking change is acceptable
2. **Testing**: Update all existing tests to use array input/output format
3. **Documentation**: Update README.md with new API specification and examples
4. **Logging**: Log batch processing metrics for monitoring
5. **Performance**: Ensure efficient processing of large batches (up to 1000 orders)

## Migration Notes

This is a breaking change to the API contract. Clients must be updated to:
- Send arrays of OrderPostDTO instead of single objects
- Handle OrderListResponseDTO responses instead of OrderWithDetailsDTO  
- Implement proper error handling for partial success scenarios (HTTP 207)

## Execution Plan

- Created comprehensive validation methods:
  - `validateOrderPostDTO()` for basic field validation
  - `validateOrderReferences()` for foreign key existence checks
- Integrated SLF4J logging with detailed batch processing metrics
- Reuses existing `create()` method to maintain consistency with single order processing
- Added proper exception handling with meaningful error messages
- Implemented non-atomic batch processing (continues processing even if some orders fail)

### Phase 3: Update Controller Layer ✅ COMPLETED
**Duration**: ~2-3 hours
**Files to Modify**:

**Tasks**:
1. ✅ Modify `@PostMapping("/api/v1/orders")` to accept `List<OrderPostDTO>`
2. ✅ Add request validation for batch size (return HTTP 413 if > 1000)
3. ✅ Add input validation for required fields (return HTTP 400)
4. ✅ Call new service method `processBatchOrders()`
5. ✅ Return appropriate HTTP status codes:
   - 200 for complete success

   - 400 for validation errors
   - 413 for oversized batches
   - 500 for unexpected errors
6. ✅ Update error handling to return `OrderListResponseDTO` format
7. ✅ Add request/response logging

**Implementation Notes**:
- Completely replaced single order endpoint with batch processing endpoint
- Added comprehensive request validation before processing:
  - Null request body validation
  - Batch size limit enforcement (1000 orders max)
  - Jakarta Bean Validation with @Valid annotation
- Implemented intelligent HTTP status code mapping with `determineHttpStatus()` helper:
  - HTTP 200 (OK): All orders succeeded
  - HTTP 207 (Multi-Status): Partial success or all failed during processing
  - HTTP 400 (Bad Request): Request validation failures
  - HTTP 413 (Payload Too Large): Batch size exceeds 1000
  - HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error): Unexpected exceptions
- Added comprehensive logging with SLF4J:
  - Request logging with batch size
  - Completion logging with processing metrics
  - Error logging for exceptions
  - Warning logging for validation failures
- Proper exception handling with try-catch blocks
- Maintains RESTful API design principles
- Breaking change from single order to batch processing (as specified)
- All code compiles successfully with existing codebase

### Phase 4: Update Tests ✅ COMPLETED
**Duration**: ~4-5 hours
**Files to Modify**:
- `src/test/java/org/kasbench/globeco_order_service/service/OrderServiceTest.java` ✅
- `src/test/java/org/kasbench/globeco_order_service/controller/OrderControllerTest.java` ✅

   - Test partial success scenarios (mixed results)
   - Test complete failure scenarios
   - Test batch size validation (1000 limit)
   - Test individual order validation within batch
   - Test trade service integration per order

   - Test request validation (malformed JSON, missing fields)
   - Test response format compliance
