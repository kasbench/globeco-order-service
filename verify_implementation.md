# Task 6 Implementation Verification

## Task Requirements
- [x] Create error classification constants for different error types (SERVICE_OVERLOADED, VALIDATION_ERROR, etc.)
- [x] Integrate error metrics with existing MeterRegistry for tracking error counts by type
- [x] Add system overload metrics (overload events, resource utilization, retry delays)
- [x] Write unit tests for metrics integration and error classification

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Error Classification Constants ✅
Created `ErrorClassification.java` with:
- Comprehensive error type constants (SERVICE_OVERLOADED, VALIDATION_ERROR, etc.)
- Utility methods for error categorization (isClientError, isServerError, isRetryable)
- Severity level classification (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Support for all error types mentioned in the design document

### 2. Error Metrics Service ✅
Created `ErrorMetricsService.java` with:
- Integration with existing MeterRegistry
- Error counters by type with proper tags (error_code, status_code, severity, retryable)
- System overload event tracking
- Resource utilization metrics (thread pool, database pool, memory)
- Error rate calculation and monitoring
- Proper initialization and lifecycle management

### 3. GlobalExceptionHandler Integration ✅
Updated `GlobalExceptionHandler.java` to:
- Use ErrorClassification constants instead of hardcoded strings
- Record error metrics for all exception types
- Track system overload events with retry delays
- Maintain backward compatibility

### 4. Metrics Integration ✅
- Integrated with existing MeterRegistry infrastructure
- Uses same conditional property (`metrics.custom.enabled`) as other metrics
- Follows same patterns as HttpMetricsService and DatabaseMetricsService
- Provides comprehensive error and system health monitoring

### 5. Unit Tests ✅
Created comprehensive test suites:
- `ErrorClassificationTest.java` - Tests all classification logic
- `ErrorMetricsServiceTest.java` - Tests metrics recording and integration
- `GlobalExceptionHandlerMetricsIntegrationTest.java` - Tests end-to-end integration

## Key Features Implemented

### Error Classification
- 20+ error type constants covering all scenarios
- Automatic categorization (client vs server errors)
- Retry behavior classification
- Severity level assignment

### Metrics Tracking
- HTTP error counters with detailed tags
- System overload event tracking
- Resource utilization gauges
- Error rate calculation
- Request/error ratio monitoring

### System Overload Monitoring
- Overload event counters by reason
- Current overload state gauge
- Retry delay recommendations
- Overload duration tracking
- Recovery event recording

### Integration Points
- Uses existing MeterRegistry
- Follows existing metrics patterns
- Conditional enablement via properties
- Graceful degradation when services unavailable

## Requirements Mapping

### Requirement 3.1 ✅
"WHEN system overload conditions occur THEN the service SHALL classify them as 503 Service Unavailable errors in logs and metrics"
- Implemented via ErrorMetricsService.recordError() with proper status codes
- System overload events tracked separately via recordSystemOverload()

### Requirement 3.3 ✅  
"WHEN the service detects different error conditions THEN it SHALL log them with appropriate severity levels and error categories"
- Implemented via ErrorClassification.getSeverityLevel()
- All errors categorized with proper severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)

### Requirement 4.1 ✅
"WHEN 503 responses are generated THEN they SHALL be tracked in service metrics with appropriate labels"
- Implemented via error counters with status_code, error_code, severity, and retryable tags
- System overload events tracked with reason-specific counters

### Requirement 4.2 ✅
"WHEN error responses are returned THEN the service SHALL emit metrics distinguishing between client errors (4xx) and server errors (5xx)"
- Implemented via status_code tags on error counters
- ErrorClassification provides isClientError/isServerError utility methods

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Metrics Structure
```
http_errors_total{error_code="SERVICE_OVERLOADED", status_code="503", severity="CRITICAL", retryable="true"}
system_overload_events_total{reason="database_connection_pool_exhausted"}
system_resource_utilization{resource_type="thread_pool"}
http_error_rate_percent
```

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure
- Uses same MeterRegistry as HttpMetricsService and DatabaseMetricsService
- Follows same conditional enablement pattern
- Integrates with SystemOverloadDetector for real-time resource monitoring
- Maintains compatibility with existing metrics configuration

## Verification Status
✅ All task requirements implemented
✅ Integration with existing metrics infrastructure
✅ Comprehensive error classification system
✅ System overload monitoring capabilities
✅ Unit test coverage for all components
✅ Follows existing code patterns and conventions
